# Writing Cheatsheet
## General
- Write complete sentences (contains a finished thought or action)
- Use only one idea per sentence
- Write the sentences as direct or straightforward statements
- No long explanatory phrase at the beginning of a direct sentence
- No marginal information somewhere in the middle of a sentence
- Write positive sentences
- Write active sentences
	- They lack words such as "was", "where", ...
	- Passive: "The improved version are presented in section x.", "Coffee was drunk at breakfast."
	- Active: "Section x presents the improved version.", "At breakfast, I drank coffee."
- Omit needless words
	- Bad: "The fact that many young scientists need a significant amount of practice to improve their written communication skills is a case in point. It can be seen from the diagram in Figure 1 that those student who regularly handed in written work performed at a higher level than those who did not."
	- Bad: "It can be seen from the graph in figure x that ..."
	- Good: "Many young scientists need practice to improve their writing. Figure 1 shows that students who wrote regularly performed better."
	- Good: "Figure x shows that ..."

## Comma
- Used in lists (“u, v, x, y, and z”) --- comma before the end only in American English
- Weaker brackets to show material that is not central to the sentence --- "Our latest results, obtained using a recently developed technique, also support our overall hypothesis."
- After linking words (e. g. "however", "furthermore")
- Do **not** use a comma before "that"

## Using "the" and "a"
- Something common --- use "a" or "an"
	- "There is a big mess on my desk."
	- "We did an experiment to verity this."
- Something specific --- use "the"
	- "The big mess on my desk is growing."
	- "The experiment verified our hypothesis."
- Universal concept --- no "a" or "an" necessary
	- "Messes are often interesting."
	- "Experiments form the basis of science."
- Word indicating possession --- no "a" or "the"

## Avoid
- Starting with "and", "but", "because" or "so"
- Ending with "too", "also", "though", "yet"
- "get"
- Vagueness, sensationalism and exaggeration
	- "a lot", "a bit", ... Better: "several", "many", "numerous"
	- "amazing", "incredible"
	- "XY will never be falsified"
